# Hugo Webpack Starter

A very minimal setup of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for assets.

## Prerequisites

- [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [node (NPM)](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Running

1. You must have hugo and node (NPM) installed
2. Run `npm start` in one terminal window
    - Or run `npm run start:webpack` and `npm run start:hugo` in separate terminal windows
3. Open a browser to `localhost:1313`
4. The generated site is served from the `public` directory (hugo's default)

## Building

1. You must have hugo and node (NPM) installed
2. Run `npm run build`
3. The generated site is served from the `public` directory (hugo's default)

## Cleaning

You can run `npm run clean` to remove any hugo and webpack generated files
